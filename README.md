# Electricity-Load-Forecasting-Anomaly-Detection
This project uses machine learning to predict electricity load demand and detect anomalies in power usage. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, it features a Random Forest Regressor trained on historical PJME hourly data, achieving a low error rate of 12%. Anomaly detection is implemented using Isolation Forest to flag irregular patterns.
